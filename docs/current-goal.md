# Current Goal

NuSelf's short-lived execution board. Completed history belongs in Git and
`CHANGELOG.md`; deferred work belongs in [`TODOs.md`](TODOs.md).

## Status

In progress — continuously audit and simplify while preserving composability.

## Current Phase

Audit the next high-cost infrastructure seams after completing shared audit
metadata validation and daemon lifecycle metadata deduplication.

## Constraints

- Preserve domain-owned registries, semantic validators, service APIs, durable
  recovery, and the single-scheduler daemon.
- Add no generic bus, facade hierarchy, compatibility shim, worker, or lock.
- Keep each reduction independently tested and committed; do not return this
  board to Idle while the persistent review goal remains active.

## Phase Evidence

- Memory, reason, persona, notification, reflection, Chat, endpoint, storage,
  and observability audit validators now compose the shared exact-field
  primitive; their registries and semantic value checks remain domain-owned.
- Daemon start/stop lifecycle projection shares one transition metadata
  builder; client/lifecycle protocol and state APIs were retained only after
  confirming current CLI/REPL production callers.
- Focused affected-domain suite: 325 passed.
- `uv run --locked pytest -q`: 2447 passed.
- `uv run --locked pyright`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

## Last Completed Goal

Simplified composable daemon audit infrastructure without merging domain
registries or changing protocol, storage, scheduler, or CLI behavior.

## Completion Evidence

- Removed the production-unused worker-timeout event, reporter, schema, and
  tests left by the former multi-worker daemon.
- Removed the constant `memory_curation_requested` chat audit field; durable
  recovery remains authoritative.
- Daemon audit domains now compose one exact-field validation primitive while
  retaining independent event definitions and producers.
- Focused daemon/shared audit suite: 71 passed.
- `uv run --locked pytest -q`: 2447 passed.
- `uv run --locked pyright`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `uv build`: `nuself-0.3.1` sdist and wheel built successfully.
